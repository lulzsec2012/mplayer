Release Notes
=============

* 0.8 "Forbidden Fruit"

General notes
-------------

This release continues the API cleanups that have begun with the
previous release. While it is binary compatible with 0.7, many parts of
the public API were deprecated and will be removed in the git master and
later releases. Note that a couple of header includes have been cleaned
up, which may require code changes in your applications. In particular,
the header "libavutil/mathematics.h" is no longer included from
"libavcodec/avcodec.h". Please consult the doc/APIchanges file to see
intended replacements for the deprecated APIs.

Furthermore, our work on the 'ffmpeg' command-line tool has resulted in
major revisions to its interface. In order to not break existing scripts
and applications, we have chosen to introduce a new tool called
'avconv', and keep the traditional 'ffmpeg' frontend for end-user's
convenience. Please see the Changelog file for details how 'avconv'
differs from 'ffmpeg'.

Additionally, this release introduces a number of new interesting codecs
such as the Apple Prores, Flash Screen Video 2 and Windows Media Image,
and muxers such as LATM or CELT in Ogg, among many others. Moreover, our
H.264 decoder has been improved to decode 4:2:2 material and our libx264
wrapper now allows to produce 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 video.

See the Changelog file for a list of significant changes.

Please note that our policy on bug reports has not changed. We still only accept
bug reports against HEAD of the Libav trunk repository. If you are experiencing
issues with any formally released version of Libav, please try a current version
of the development code to check if the issue still exists. If it does, make your
report against the development code following the usual bug reporting guidelines.


API changes
-----------

A number of additional APIs have been introduced and some existing
functions have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in the next
release. Please see the file doc/APIchanges for details along with
similar programmer-centric information.
